Description: Modified implementation of the MAGIC algorithm that allows the users to 
	separately pass a batch-corrected low-dimensional representation of the data to be used for the calculation of the powered marcov 
	affinity matrix. This allows MAGIC to work complementary to existing single-cell alignment/batch correction tools. Using MAGIC in 
	this manner effectively maintains overlap of identical cell types from different batches while enhancing distinction of batch-specific 
	cell types.
